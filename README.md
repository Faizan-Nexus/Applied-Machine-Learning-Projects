# Applied-Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository showcases my journey in **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** — from Python practice to advanced models.  
It is designed to highlight my ability to **implement, explain, and apply ML concepts** in a structured, reproducible way.

## Repository Structure

- **Python-Practice/**  
  Foundational exercises in Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  
  Focus: data preprocessing, visualization, and exploratory analysis.

- **Classical-ML/**  
  Implementations of traditional machine learning algorithms.  
  Examples: Random Forest, Isolation Forest, and other classifiers/regressors.

- **Deep-Learning/**  
  Experiments with modern neural network architectures.  
  Examples: Vision Transformer, EfficientNet, and CNN-based models.

- **Applied-ML/**  
  Real-world inspired projects.  
  Example: Churn modeling classifiers for customer retention analysis.
