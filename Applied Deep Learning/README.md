# Applied & Deep Learning Projects

This folder combines **deep learning experiments** and **applied machine learning projects**.  
It highlights both technical exploration of architectures and their application to real-world datasets.

## Current Projects

- **Vision Transformer (ViT) – Chest X-ray Dataset (Multiclass)**  
  Implemented ViT on a chest X-ray dataset with **5 classes** for multiclass classification.  
  Focus: healthcare diagnostics, comparison with CNN baselines, and interpretability using **Grad-CAM** visualizations (details in notebook).

- **EfficientNet – Image Classification**  
  Implemented ViT on a chest X-ray dataset with **5 classes** for multiclass classification.  
  Focus: exploring modern deep learning architectures and evaluating performance.

- **Churn Modeling – Business Data**  
  Built classifiers to predict customer churn using tabular datasets.  
  Focus: applied ML for business decision-making and customer retention analysis.

## Purpose
- Showcase ability to implement deep learning architectures.  
- Demonstrate application of ML to diverse domains (healthcare, business).  
- Provide end-to-end workflows: preprocessing, training, evaluation, visualization.

## Notes
- Each project includes its own notebook with explanations.  
- Some datasets are public, others are simulated for demonstration.  
- Future projects will expand into other domains (NLP, quantum ML).
- Notebooks are ready to run for kaggle.
