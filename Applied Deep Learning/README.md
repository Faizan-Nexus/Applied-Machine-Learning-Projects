# Classical Machine Learning

This folder contains implementations of traditional machine learning algorithms using **Scikit-learn**.

## Contents
- Random Forest Classifier
- Isolation Forest (anomaly detection)
- Other classifiers/regressors (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)

## Goal
To show understanding of classical ML techniques, their strengths/limitations, and ability to apply them to datasets.
